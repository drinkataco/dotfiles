* `[(`, `[{`, `[<` - Previous bracket
* `])`, `]}`, `]>` - Next bracket
* `[m` - Previous method start
* `[M` - Next method start

#### Searching

#### Jumps

- `<C-O>` - Go to previous jump
- `<C-I>` Go to next jump
- `gf` - Go to file in cursor

#### Markers / Bookmarks

Reference: [Using Marks](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Using_marks)

* `mx` - Set mark, where **x* * can be any character

* `]\`` - jump to next lowercase mark
* `[\`` - jump to previous lowercase mark 
* `:delmarks x` - Delete Mark

### Text Objects

Objects can be modified by 3 keys â€“ the first being the operator (such as **c** for change), the second being the method (such as **i** for inner), and the last being the text object (such as **w** for word). So `caw` would be change around word.

#### Operators

* `c` - Change
* `d` - Delete
* `v` - Visual
* `y` - Yank

#### Method

* `a` - Around; include whitespace/newline
* `i` - Inner; inside object only

#### Text Objects

* `p` - Paragraph
* `w`- Word
* `s` - Sentence
  `[`,` (`, `{`, `<`A -  [], (), or {} block
* `'`,  `"` - A quoted string
* `t`A -  XML tag block

### Inserting and Editing

#### Standard

* `a` - Append
* `A` - Append from end of line
* `i` - Insert
* `o` - Insert above line
* `O` - Insert below line
* `s` - Delete char and insert
* `S` - Delete line and insert
* `C` Delete until end of line and insert
* `r` - Replace one character
* `R` - Enter Replace mode
* `u` - Undo Changes
* `<C-R` - Redo changes

#### Visual Block

- Use `Ctrl+V` to enter visual block mode
- Move Up/Downto select the columns of text in the lines you want to comment.
- Then either:
  - `<S-i>` - Insert
  - `c` - Change
- Then hit `Esc`, wait 1 second and the inserted text will appear on every line.

### Searching and Replacing

#### Searching

* `/{REGEX}`
  * `ctrl-g` - go to next found
  * `ctrl-t` - go to previous 
  * `ctrl-p` - previous search (history-1)
  * `ctrl-n` - next search (history+1)

### Code Folding

* `zo` - Open fold /`zO` Open fold recursively
* `zc` - Close fold /`zC` Close fold recursively
* `za` - Toggle fold
* `zM` - Close all folds
* `zR` - Open all folds

## Files, Buffers, and Tabs

On top of editing singular files we can use Vim to organise files in tabs. We can create new files (via buffers) and

### Netrw

File navigation is done with `netrw`: `:Explore`, `:Sexplore`,`:Vexplore`, `Texplore`.

And within **netrw**, we'll want to manipulate the files:

- `<C-r>` - Open directory/file
- `<del>` - Delete file
- `<C-l>` - Refresh directory
- `d` - CREATE a directory
- `%` - CREATE a new file
- `D` - DELETE a file/firectory
- `p` - PREVIEW a file
- `R` - RENAME a file or directory
- `o` - OPEN file/directory in HORIZONTAL split
- `v` - OPEN file/direxctory in VERTICAL split
- `x` - OPEN file in system file editor (useful for binary files, for example)
- `gn` - CHANGE root directory
- `-` - CHANGE directory to parent

See https://gist.github.com/danidiaz/37a69305e2ed3319bfff9631175c5d0f for an exhaustive list

#### Copying Files

1. `mt` - mark destination directory
2. `mf` - mark file
3. `mc` - perform copy

### Buffers

* `<C-o>` - Go to previous buffer (jump)
* `<C-i>` - Go to next buffer (jump) if set
* `:tabnew` - New buffer in tab
* `:new` - New buffer in horizontal split 
* `:Vnew` - New buffer in vertical split

### Tabs

* `gt` - Go to next tab
* `gT` - Go to previous tab
* `3gt` - Go the third tab

Mode-specific usage
