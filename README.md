# dotfiles

A collection of my dotfiles with an easy installer to get your environment up to speed quickly.

Supported:

- macOS
- Linux (Ubuntu and CentOS tested)

### Installation
Just run install.sh with bash 4 and fill out the questions to copy the files.

Certain dotfiles have variables nested within them which are likely differ between environments. Adjust the values in config/variables before you run install.sh to set them.
