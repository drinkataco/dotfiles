# dotfiles

This repository is a place for me to store my dotfiles, personal documentation, and any application or OS specific workflows (such as homebrew files).

My main workspace is vim inside tmux with zsh shell.

## Installation

All files can be symlinked (with subdirectories taking a merge strategy) with the POSIX `./install.sh` script.

## Informaton

### Vim

With thanks to [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) as the language server, and plugins such as [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) for searching, and [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for git workflows, and [vim-spector](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector) for debugging, among several others.
