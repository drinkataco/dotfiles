# dotfiles

This is my swiss army knife. It contains my dotfiles for my day-to-day, as well as some application configuration and general scripts used here and there often.

My main workspace is vim inside tmux with zsh shell.

## Installation

All files can be symlinked (with subdirectories taking a merge strategy) with the POSIX compliant `./install.sh` script.
